# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

üöÄ Project Title: Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Business Insights

üîç Project Overview:
In today's fast-paced digital world, understanding public sentiment is crucial for businesses, brands, and organizations. I developed a Twitter sentiment analysis project that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze public sentiment from tweets. This project provides valuable insights for businesses looking to enhance their customer engagement strategies and improve their products and services.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Imported the data using the pandas read_csv function.
2. Data Preprocessing: Implemented robust data preprocessing techniques, including stop word removal, and stemming, to prepare the text data for analysis.
3. Text to Numerical Conversion: Converted the textual data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF to facilitate machine learning.
4. Model Training: Trained a logistic regression model on the processed data to classify tweets into positive and negative sentiments.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy score to ensure its effectiveness.
6. Model Saving: Saved the trained model using pickle for future use and deployment.
7. Prediction: Utilized the saved model to predict sentiments of new tweets, providing real-time sentiment analysis.

üìà Technologies and Tools:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn(TF-IDF Vectorization, Logistic regression, accuracy score), Pandas, NLTK(stopwords, PorterStemmer)
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression
- Model Saving: Pickle

üí° Business Applications:
- Customer Feedback Analysis: Monitor and analyze customer feedback in real-time to improve products and services.
- Marketing Campaigns: Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and understand public reception.
- Brand Management: Track brand sentiment and respond proactively to negative sentiments.
- Competitor Analysis: Analyze competitors' public perception to stay ahead in the market.
